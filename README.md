# PlaylistGPT

PlaylistGPT is a fun little web application that allows you to ask questions about your Spotify playlists and receive answers from code generated by OpenAI's models (GPT-3.5 by default).

**WARNING: This project is currently under construction and very limited in features. It uses Python's `exec()` command to automatically execute code generated by GPT, so run at your own risk.**

## Installation

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/savbell/playlist-gpt.git
cd playlist-gpt
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # For Linux and macOS
venv\Scripts\activate # For Windows
```


3. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


4. Set up the necessary API keys:

- Sign up for an OpenAI account at [https://beta.openai.com/signup/](https://beta.openai.com/signup/).
- After your account is created, visit the OpenAI API dashboard at [https://beta.openai.com/dashboard/api-keys](https://beta.openai.com/dashboard/api-keys) and copy your API key.
- Get a Spotify API key by following the instructions at [https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/).


5. Configure the environment variables:

- Copy the ".env.example" file to a new file named ".env":
```
cp .env.example .env # For Linux and macOS
copy .env.example .env # For Windows
```
- Open the ".env" file and add in the necessary values:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id_here
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret_here
SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=your_spotify_redirect_uri_here
```


6. (Optional) Change the OpenAI model:

- By default, the app uses the "gpt-3.5-turbo" model. If you want to use a [different model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models), modify the "OPENAI_MODEL" value in the ".env" file.
- Note that access to models depends on your OpenAI account's access level, and you may be charged for use if you're on a paid plan.


7. Run the Flask app:
```
export FLASK_APP=app.py # For Linux and macOS
set FLASK_APP=app.py # For Windows
flask run
```


6. Open the web application in your browser at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).
